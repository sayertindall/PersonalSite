    "bio":"My professional life began immediately after high school. At 18, I volunteered for the Navy's Nuclear Engineering program, completed the two-year school, and worked with two nuclear reactors onboard the USS Stennis for four years. I specialized in the electrical distribution systems, maintaining balance and continuity within the system. The program provided me with industry and operational experience at a young age. Seeing system-level operations during high intensity evolutions garnered an interest in the conceptualization, research, and design of other complex systems. I like to look at the big picture and determine how to make it bigger (or more efficient).",
